# MIDNIGHT
this is my repository for my first hack club project and going towards the midnight hackathon in austria. im making little website with a bunch of fun games i can play and mess around with when bored in class every week or so ill be adding in a new game hopefully they improve in quality as i move through as first time coding a proper game that im going to put online, spend most of my time fixing electronics and workin on some robotics stuff esp32,arduino and allat.

Anyways i just built a nice little homepage with some art i spent way to long tryna draw on dodgy laptop and then followed tutorial on making pong game changed some speed made the bouncing more random though and then i made it a bit cool with you can put a pciture of anything on the ball and i added in a little freeze diamond upgrade for fun ig. 

then i went on to make this game called DONT GET CAUGHT where u can run away from your own mouse tryna catch you add if you get caught well then game over and theres some dash button and maybe ill add invisabilty potion and im yet to add sprites.
then theirs a two player mode i wanted so you can play with person beside you where you both control a charachter running away its more open world to a limit and one player has master control and basically theres a split button that splits the cursor in too to try trap yoour oponent and some other stuff to js make it competitive.
sorry this readme is real long but i just need to make sure im clear and get qualified to go to austria!(i told way to many people to motivate myself to finish 50 hours)
